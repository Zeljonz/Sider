                Cerastium neoscardicum, from the serpentinite massif of Mt. Ostrovica,
                 has an indumentum somewhat similar to that of C. alpinum var. lanatum (Lam.) Hegetschw,
                  but with thinner and more matted hairs, similar to those in C. decalvans. This species shows
                   great morphological variability and several characters are intermediate between those of C.
                    alpinum and C. decalvans. The same ploidy and morphological similarity of C. alpinum and C.
                     neoscardicum on Mts. Šar-Planina suggest that morphological differentiation followed the ecological divergence, C.
                      alpinum growing at higher elevations on silicate and carbonate substrates, and C.
                       neoscardicum colonizing the warmer ultramafic terrains at lower altitudes.
                        Similar differentiation of C. alpinum related to different substrates is known from 
                        Fennoscandia, but Berglund (2005) showed that populations on serpentinite are genetically
                         not significantly different from populations on other substrates, suggesting that the
                          serpentinite populations have evolved recently. This might also be the case with C.
                           alpinum and C. neoscardicum on Mts. Šar-Planina.
