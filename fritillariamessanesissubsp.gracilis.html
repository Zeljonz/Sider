                Fritillaria messanensis is a European species of flowering plant in the lily family,
                 native to southeastern Europe: Italy (Sicily, Calabria), Greece (incl. Crete), Albania, former Yugoslavia.<br> <br>
                 •	Fritillaria messanensis subsp. gracilis (Ebel) Rix - Ionian Islands of Greece, Albania, Serbia, Croatia, Montenegro, Bosnia, Macedonia, Kosovo <br>
                 •	Fritillaria messanensis subsp. messanensis - Greece, Sicily, Calabria <br>
                 •	Fritillaria messanensis subsp. neglecta (Parl.) Nyman - Croatia, Macedonia <br>
                 •	Fritillaria messanensis subsp. sphaciotica (Gand.) Kamari & Phitos - Crete<br> <br>
                 
              
                  Fritillaria messanensis s.l. inhabits various habitats in the Balkans:
                   from Submediterranean forests and scrub communities along the Adriatic coast of Dalmatia and Montenegro,
                    to high-mountain pastures and rocky grounds in the Dinaric Alps facing the Adriatic. It prefers limestone
                     occasionally ophiolitic geological substrate. In Greece, it occupies stony places Fritillaria messanensis s.l.
                     inhabits various habitats in the Balkans: from Submediterranean forests and scrub communities along the
                      Adriatic coast of Dalmatia and Montenegro, to high-mountain pastures and rocky grounds in the Dinaric Alps
                       facing the Adriatic. It prefers limestone, occasionally ophiolitic geological substrate. In Greece,
                        it occupies stony places under a dense scrub canopy, woodlands, and occasionally clearings of Pinus 
                        or Fagus forests, usually on calcareous substrate (Kamari & Phitos 2006).
                         It grows on limestone and serpentinite rocks and pastures in Albania, reaching altitudes
                          as high as 1800 m (Jávorka 1926). In Serbia, F. gracilis grows on high-mountain limestone 
                          rocks, rocky grounds and pastures in the Prokletije Mts, at an altitude above 1300 m.
                           Some significant differences in the species habitats, ranging from warm Submediterranean
                            to cold high-mountain, require further detailed taxonomic and molecular investigations of F.
                             gracilis populations in the Dinaric Alps.
