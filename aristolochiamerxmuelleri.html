                The steno-endemic species Aristolochia merxmuelleri Greuter et E. Mayer is the species of serpentine,
                 which grows in Kosovo in a very limited area. It can be found at the foot of Koznik Mountain between the localities of 
                 Llapçevë and Mrasor, on the left side of the river Mirusha, in bushy places with a
                  rocky serpentine base at altitudes of 400–660 m. It was concluded by Greuter and Mayer in 1985,
                   in the same locality as it has been found nowadays (Mayer & Greuter 1985).<br>
                   The research of this Aristolochia merxmuelleri species was performed during these three years (April 2000 – April 2003).
                    During the research the common fields methods were used, which are being practiced in floristic research.
                     For determining and verifying of this kind we have relied on the scientific work of Greuter & E. Mayer (1985). 
                     Also we have used different floras where the genus Aristolochia is described (Paparisto & al. 1988;
                      Tutin & al. 1964; Polunin 1997). In these papers the species of Aristolochia merxmuelleri is not described at all.
                       In Rexhepi (1999), the Aristolochia merxmuelleri is mentioned in the frame of Aristolochiaceae family
                        and there is presented as an endemic plant of Kosovo.
                        . While in paper The Endemic Plants of Kosovo (Rexhepi 2000), this Aristolochia merxmuelleri
                         species has been described in full detail but without details about the real condition and vitality of this species
                          in the field. Krasniqi (2003), presents completely the real condition of the species Aristolochia merxmuelleri,
                           and describes all the characteristics and its actual condition in the field.
                            In this paper, apart from some already known characteristics, a
                             presentation is given of the actual state of this kind in the field. 
                             Her barizing is done very carefully and according to the standard methods of herbarizing the vascular flora.
                              In general in relation to the Aristolochia merxmuelleri species, data from the Internet are used.
                               This determination of coordinates is done by the apparatus GPS 12 (GARMIN’S GPS Personal Navigator 1997),
                                so according to these measures the area is determined and the surface calculation area of Aristolochia merxmuelleri
                                 species is also given.<br><br>
                                
                                 The area of species Aristolochia merxmuelleri is in the region of Mirusha, at the foot of Koznik Mountain, between the localities of Llapçevë and Mrasor.
                                  The area has a very small surface. The substratum is rocky serpentine, while vegetation is bushy.
                                   In the same localities where this kind grows there are also some species endemic to Balkans or Kosovo, such as: Aster albanicus subsp.
                                    albanicus, Centaurea albertii, Centaurea kosaninii, Forsythia europaea, Fumana bonapartei, Genista hassertiana, Halacsya sendtneri, Linum elegans, Malus florentina, Moltkia doerfleri, Polygala doerfleri, Pinguicula hirtiflora, Potentilla visianii, Sanguisorba albanica, Sedum serpentinii, Stipa mayeri and Veronica andrasovszkyi.
                                     Within this area there some other species growing, such as: Prunus mahaleb, Aethionema saxatile, Tulipa scardica, Iris reichenbachii, Euphorbia glabriflora, Salvia ringens var.
                                      baldacciana, Quercus pubescens, Juniperus oxycedrus subsp.
                                       oxycedrus, Acer tataricum, Alyssum markgrafi, Cheilanthes maranthae, Asplenium cuneifolium, Pinguicula hirtiflora, etc.
