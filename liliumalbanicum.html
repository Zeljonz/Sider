                     Bulb of medium size, reddish. Tree erect, slender, bare and leafless in the lower part
                      and upwards with alternately arranged, mutually compacted, linearly lanceolate leaves. 
                      These are up to 7 cm long, pointed towards the top, up to 1.5 cm wide at the bottom of
                       the tree, and gradually narrower at the top (only 2-3 mm), bare but covered with ciliated
                       hairs along the rim. Inflorescence apical, with 1-2 large, golden-yellow, orange or mini-yellow flowers, up to 3.5 cm in diameter. Leaves perigon lanceolate, on the inside at the base with warts and brown streaks. Anthers shorter than perigon leaves, anthers the color of minjum. Fruit erect, 2.5-3.5 cm long cocoon. Flowering VI-VII. This lily is similar to the related head (Lilium jankae) but has thinner leaves and only one apical flower on the stem.
                  A plant of high mountain (subalpine and alpine) meadows and grassy areas, most often on a serpentine base.
                      Endemic to the Balkan Peninsula, it lives only in Serbia (West and Kosovo), Montenegro,
