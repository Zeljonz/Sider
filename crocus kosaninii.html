                The genus Crocus is relatively well researched in the Balkan Peninsula (Mathew, 1983; Ranđelović et al., 1990, 2007;
                 Uzundžalieva, 2005). Regardless, more not all taxonomic problems are always solved,
                 so it is very common for some taxa to be authored considered species, and some subspecies or varieties.
                  One of the sections within which yet there is always room for detailed taxonomic
                   research is the section Verni Mathew 1982, from which are known in Serbia of three species:
                    Crocus vernus Hill, C. tommasinianus Herb. and C. kosaninii Pulević (Randjelović et al., 1990).
                     The most recently discovered (Pulević, 1976) is species C.
                      kosaninii, and therefore there is the least data about it in the literature.
                       Given that it is this is an endemic species whose complete range is based on previous
                        knowledge borders of Serbia, in this paper we investigated the anatomical and morphological 
                        characteristics of three population of Crocus kosaninii Pulević in southern Serbia.<br>


                

                  
                  Crocus kosaninii, are located in southern Serbia, in the vicinity of Leskovac, on the road for Vučje.
                   I also received approximate information from professors Vladimir and Novica Randjelovic where to look
                    for another hitherto unexplored population, which I found on locality of Šainovačka livada. In the field,
                     we observed the properties of plants that are lost by herbariuming the material, as well as the population
                      structure itself. We are plants in the field photographed, observed their habitats and the conditions in which they develop.
                       Material-whole plants in bloom was collected in February and March this year.
                        Whole plants with tubers that are we were often at a greater depth, we took them out of the ground
                         with the help of a shovel, packed them in paper ones bags to protect the delicate parts of the plants from
                          possible damage during transport and preserved the material in its original form 
                          in order to obtain valid results in laboratories. The plants were collected at the sites of Strojkovce,
                           Šainovačke livade and Veliko Trnjane. From 20 to 30 individuals were collected from each population.
                            The tubers are undamaged later planted for the purpose of keeping saffron in the garden of Professor Novica Randjelovic.
                             After collection and determination in the field, and prepared for work in the laboratory where it was
                              performed detailed analysis of the collected material. The material was herbarized by the standard method.
