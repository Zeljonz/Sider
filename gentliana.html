                    Arnaut raven (lat. Gentiana punctata), also known as spotted lynx, 
                    spotted rennet, spotted lynx, etc. is a plant from the lincura family (Gentianaceae). 
                    It is used in folk medicine, like other species within the genus. It is a protected species in Serbia.

                    The Latin name of the genus was given after the Illyrian ruler Gencius,
                     who recommended yellow lynx (G. lutea) for the treatment of plague, while the 
                     species was named after the characteristic dotted patterns on the flower (lat. Punctum = dot).
                     <br>
                     The Arnaut plain is a species characteristic of the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe.
                      It grows on silicate substrates, at an altitude of 1400 - 2500 m. It occurs on rocky pastures and mornings,
                      and most often in coniferous forests.

                         In our environment, the Arnaut level can be found, except in the mountains of Serbia, in Croatia,
                          Montenegro, Macedonia, Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
                          <br>
                          Arnaut raven is a perennial herbaceous plant. It has a thick, cylindrical rhizome, up to 1 m long and branched. 
                          The tree is 20-60 cm high, upright, unbranched and hollow, in the upper part usually colored light purple. 
                          The leaves in the ground part of the tree are short, on the stalks, while in the upper part of the tree they are opposite,
                           edible, ovate or elliptical. They are arranged crosswise on the tree and cover it densely. 
                           The flowers are conspicuous, sessile, gathered in the axils of the leaves at the top of the tree or at its top. 
                           The calyx is bell-shaped,the crown is bell-shaped or plate-shaped, light yellow in color with dark purple spots. 
                           The fruit is a cocoon. 
                           <br>
                           The Arnaut level has applications in folk medicine. It is collected as a medicinal plant with
                            a similar effect as yellow lynx.  The root (rhizome) (Gentianae cruciatae radix) is collected. 
                            It is harvested during the summer and the beginning of autumn, when the plant is in the flowering phase.
                             It is bitter and is an excellent appetite stimulant.

                             The Arnaut level is protected by law and its harvesting is regulated by law.
