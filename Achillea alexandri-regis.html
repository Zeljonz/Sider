                    Achillea is widespread in Kosovo; so far 18 species have been recorded, 
                    of which 10 are strictly protected species (Administrative directive of MESP no. 12/2017),
                     including Achillea alexandri-regis Bornm. & Rudsky, spread only in Oshlak (Sharri Mountains, Kosovo).

                     The purpose of this research was to identify morpho-anatomical
                      characteristics that could be used as markers for the accurate identification of 
                      A. alexandri-regis. Morpho-anatomical characteristics were analyzed in 10 individuals, collected in Oshlak,
                       during the July 2017. For identification of anatomical characteristics, the leaves were cut into small pieces
                        (approximately 1cm2 ), while pigments were removed in advance with hydrogen peroxide and saturated chloral hydrate solution. 
                        Microscopic analyzes were made with the Zeiss axiostar plus microscope. The following morphological characteristics were
                         analyzed: plant height (20-40 cm), phyllotaxy (alternate), length (3.05±0.63 cm) and width (0.75±0.22 cm) of stem leaves,
                          length (7.05±1.63 cm) and width (1.72±0.31 cm) of the basal leaves, their shape (linear to cuneate), inflorescence type
                           (corymb), the number of flowers in the inflorescence (16.75±6.66), the color of the flowers (yellow), 
                           etc. While the anatomical structures analyzed in leaves were: number of stomas (98.4±16.87/mm2 in upper epidermis
                            and 102.9±17.91/mm2 in lower epidermis), stomas dimension (length: 33.7±2.22 μm in upper epidermis
                             and 33.2±2.22 μm in the lower epidermis; width: 26.2±1.10 μm in upper epidermis and 25.7±0.99 μm in lower epidermis),
                              the number of glandular trichomes (3.64 ±5.27/mm2 in upper epidermis and 1.57±2.16/mm2 in lower epidermis),
                               the number of trichomes (21.71±8.21/mm2 in upper epidermis and 20.86±4.26/mm2 in lower epidermis). Furthermore, 
                               the thickness of the upper (27.07±1.06 μm) and lower (23.02±0.88 μm) epidermis, the thickness of
                                the palisade (99.8±4.56 μm) and spongy parenchyma (84.5±6.74 μm) were also analyzed too. On the stems
                                 were analyzed the number (22.6±1.89) and the type of vascular bundles (collateral type).
