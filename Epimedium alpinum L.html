                    The mountain bishop's cap (lat. Epimedium alpinum) is a perennial herbaceous plant, 
                    a species from the genus Epimedium from the family Berberidaceae. It grows in Croatia, 
                    Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia and Italy.

                    The height of the plants is up to 30 cm. The leaves are heart-shaped, semi-evergreen, in spring pink shades.
                     In autumn they get a reddish bronze hue. There are 12-20 small, red-yellow flowers in bloom. 
                     The root is horizontal, creeping.

                     It is used in horticulture, but Asian species are more often used for cultivation. 
                     The mentioned species are also used in traditional 
                     medicine in China, Korea and Japan. In our country, the use of E. alpinum for medical purposes is not known, 
                     but scientific analyzes have shown that this plant also contains the alkaloid magnoflorin, which has so far
                      been considered typical of the aforementioned.
