                Weston subsp. flavus and Crocus flavus subsp. dissectus T.
                 Baytop&Mathew (endemic) are two close taxa of Crocus flavus Weston.
                  Their morphologies are smilar but have some differences when examined carefully.
                   However, Crocus genus have useful leaf anatomical characteristics that are significantly different from each other.
                    Leaves show useful taxonomical features according to carina, vascular bundles and arms of the leaf.
                     In this study, it is aimed to compare morphology and leaf cross sections of these two taxa in a detailed way with photographs.
                      Especiallay, the difference between their stylus braches number,
                       seed macromorphology and general view of leaf cross
                        sections in the point of vascular bundles combination have significant taxonomical importance.<br><br>

                  
                  The genus Crocus L. (Iridaceae) presently about 100 species in mainly Mediterranean Region and
                   the drier floristic area Irano-Turanien Region.
                    The majority of species are restricted Turkey and Balkans (Candan 2007).
                     Crocus genus is known about 150 taxa in the world (Harpke et al. 2013).
                      According to Kerndorff and Pasche (2004) southwestern Turkey is the current center of Crocus genus.
                       Crocus taxa in Turkey reached about 120 taxa (73 species) (Mathew 1982, 1984, 1998, 2000, 2002;
                        Yüzbaşıoğlu and Varol 2004; Erol et al. 2011; Candan and Özhatay 2013; Harpke et al. 2013; Kerndorrf et al.
                         2013a, 2013b, 2013c, Ruksans 2013; Yüzbaşıoğlu and Özhatay 2014).
                          As is known, the styles and stigmas are collected and dried to be used mainly
                           as a seasoning and colouring agent in food. Saffron, among the world's countries,
                            is the most valuable spices by weight. On the other hand, Crocus species are being growth 
                            for delicating parks and gardens. In the point of its agricultural importance,
                             this genus has a commercially significance in the world (Candan, 2007).
                              Mathew wrote the book ‘The Crocus’ (1982), after this great work some different
                               investigations on the Crocus genus taxa were made about their ecology, anatomy, cytology,
                                palynology and genetics (Kerndorff and Pasche 2004, 2006, 2011; Işık and Oybak Dönmez 2006;
                                 Candan 2007; Candan et al. 2009a, 2009b; Şık et al, 2008; Kandemir 2009; Şık and Candan 2009; Coşkun et al.
                                  2010; Candan and Özhatay 2013; Harpke et al. 2013).
                                   Crocus leaves are irreplaceable and attractive leaves in the point of their shapes
                                    when they are studied under microscope. Because of that reason, there are also some 
                                    investigations made about some Crocus taxa distributed all over the world deliberatelly about
                                     their leaf anatomy (Collins 1937, Karasawa 1942, Shorina 1975, Rudall 1990, 1992, Rudall and Mathew 1990).
                                      In these studies, especially according to Rudall and Mathew (1990),
                                       characteristic features and general importance of leaf blade cross sections
                                        were determined. The leaves of Crocus species hold keel at the center of the leaf and
                                         two arms next to the keel which is a unique shape regarding cross
                                          sections for the genus (Rudall and Mathew, 1990).
                                           As is seen, there aren’t any detailed comparative study on C.
                                            flavus subsp. flavus and C. flavus subsp. dissectus. Therefore,
                                             the initial objective of this study was to investigate the comparison
                                              of morphology and leaf anatomy as regards populations of these two yellow
                                               flowered taxa naturally distributed in Anatolia
