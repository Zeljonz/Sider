                Stipa mayeri 
                It  is  a  perennial  herbaceous  plant,  with the 
                stem up  to   cm length.  It is  an  endemic  spe-
                cies of  Kosovo. It was discovered by  the Czech 
                botanist  Jan Otokar  Martinovsky in   (Rex-
                hepi from the herbarium material collect-
                ed previously on  serpentine territory of Kosovo 
                by the Slovenian botanist E. Mayer, by whom it 
                was  named. In  Kosovo it  is spread  in Mirushë, 
                Koznik and Gurana. It is characteristic species of 
                the association.<br><br>
                The  association  Stipeto-Convolvuletum  com-
pacti ass. nova is well differentiated in its floristic 
structure. The characteristic species of the associ-
ation and some serpentinophyte species are usu-
ally  present in  this association.  There  exist  dif-
ferences in the aspect of flora and vegetation of 
Gurana,  where the  association  Stipeto-Convolvu-
letum compacti is located, and other serpentines. 
This is a consequence of the climate conditions,
up easily, thus creating a dry rocky land. The alti-
tude of these terrains varies between m. 
There are mostly South, West, South-East, South-
West and East expositions,  while the terrain  in-
clination  is degrees. The  soil  is relatively 
degraded – typical rendzina on serpentine. The 
community  is  being  developed  in  the  form  of 
open type because  of the  terrain  configuration. 
In these terrains degradation of soils and vegeta-
tion is evident. The characteristic species of  the 
association are: Convolvulus compactus, Stipa may-
eri, Achillea coarctata and Agropyron cristatum.
The  association  Stipeto-Convolvuletum  com-
pacti Millaku et  al. ass. nova  belongs to the  al-
liance Centaureo-Bromion fibrosi Bleč. et al. 
which is represented with a considerable number 
of species with constancy V and IV such as: Thy-
mus  lykae,  Alyssum  markgrafii,  Euphorbia  glabri-
flora,  Bromus  fibrosus  [B.  erectus  subsp.  fibrosus], 
Galium lucidum [G. gerardi] (Rexhepi 
Krasniqi  &  Millak).  Also the 
order  Halacsyetalia  sendtneri  Rt (Rexhepi 
Krasniqi  & Millaku  is repre-
sented  with  an  appreciable  number  of  species 
with higher constancy, such as: Astragalus onobrygeographic position and floristic structure. Thus, 
endemic species: Genista hassertiana, Aster albani-
cus, Forsythia europaea, Tulipa scardica, Aristolochia 
merxmuelleri,  Halacsya  sendtneri,  Linum  elegans, 
Saponaria intermedia, Veronica andrazovszkyi, that 
belong  to  the  associations:  Polygalo-Genistetum 
hasertianae,  Potentillo-Fumanetum  bonapartei,  As-
tero–Junipertum  oxycedri,  Sedo-Bornmullerietum 
dieckii are  not present in the  association  Stipeto-
Convolvuletum compacti; whereas  species Convol-
vulus compactus, Achillea coarctata, Iris pallida and 
Colchicum hungaricum,  which are present in this 
association,  are absent  in  the  associations men-
tioned  above.  The  association  Stipeto-Convolvu-
letum  compacti  ass. nova  belongs to  the alliance 
Centaureo-Bromion fibrosi Bleč.  et al.  , order 
Halacsyetalia sendtneri  Rt. and  in the  class 
Festuco-Brometea Br. Bl. et R. Tx.
